        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <p>Hey, I'm Austin—an introverted but super cool kid who loves coding and archery. I enjoy learning new things, helping others, and talking (a lot). When I'm not coding, you'll find me reading books or chatting with friends. Huge thanks to <a href="https://x.com/TimmyRetro">Retro</a> for the inspiration!</p>
        
        <p>I'm basically a professional music listener. <small>(Yes, that sounds cringe, but it's true.)</small> I spend most of my time listening to music, especially dream pop, indie, and lofi.</p>
        
        <p>By the way, I'm making this website as mobile-friendly as possible! :D</p>
        
        <p>I don’t play many games. I see their worth but don't dedicate myself to gaming. That said, I do play Roblox, where I focus on developing and scripting more than just playing.</p>
        
        <p>I have a deep interest in Greek history, philosophy, and etymology. It’s fascinating how different people interpret Greek culture, from religion to language. Can you believe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronus">Cronus</a> swallowed all his children?!</p>
        
        <p>As for my work experience... well, let’s see: helping others develop Roblox games, coding awesome websites like this one, and improving my full-stack development skills since early 2023. But professionally? None. Yet.</p>
