            <p>Welcome.</p>
            <p>Today I am your host, Austin. Heres all the stuff you need to know about me.</p>
            <p>I spend all of my time, hanging out with friends, shooting a bow, coding, or gaming.</p>
            <p>I am a male, and i have been trying to build up courage to ask someone out...</p>
            <p>I have been coding since early 2020, but, with my growing older, my skills have had a huge growth, over those 4 years</p>
            <p>I love learning, and teaching!</p>

            </h1>
            <p>I shoot archery, I game, I talk, a lot.</p>
            <p>Some of my favorite coding languages relate to: Html, CSS, JS, Python, C#, and last but not least yet, Lua.</p>
            <p>I care about basic grammar, such commas and puncuation</p>
            <p>I try to be active, and i try to respond to messages, if you want you can email me at <a href="mailto:nullaustin2007@gmail.com">here</a></p>
            <p>I care for everything, some way or another. Im sure I have stories to tell you, on that.</p>
